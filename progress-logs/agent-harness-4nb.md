## Reflector Synthesis

The standardization of closure notes has been successfully implemented across doc-agent, dot-gemini, and agent-harness. The addition of the 'bd-note' alias provides a direct path for agents to follow their intuition while remaining compliant with the underlying 'bd comments add' command. Documentation in the SOP checklist and finalization phase ensures that all future agents will be aware of this requirement and the available tools.
