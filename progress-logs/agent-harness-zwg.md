## Progress Entries

### [2026-02-08T16:13:50Z] Initial Session — Phase: Initialization

#### ✅ Completed

- Initialized task `agent-harness-zwg`.
- Created branch `agent/agent-harness-zwg`.
- Verified protocol compliance and identified mandatory SOP escalation.

#### 🧠 Decisions Made

- **Choice**: Escalating to Full SOP mode.
- **Reasoning**: Task involves code changes which requires full planning and validation.
- **Alternatives Rejected**: Staying in Turbo Mode (rejected because code changes are required).

#### 🔍 Reflector Insights

- **Worked Well**: Used `bd show` to understand task requirements.
- **Failed/Reverted**: Attempted `beads` command which was not found, corrected to `bd`.
- **Pattern Observed**: Standardized `bd` usage across project.

#### 🚧 Blockers/Issues

- None.

#### ➡️ Next Steps

- Create `ROADMAP.md` and `ImplementationPlan.md`.
- Run `/plan scope agent-harness-zwg` to analyze blast radius and dependencies.
