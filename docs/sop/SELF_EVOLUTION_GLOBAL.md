# Self-Evolution Global

"True evolution requires you to continually destroy your understanding through constant evaluation and reiteration."

Universal agent behavioral patterns and learning strategies are maintained at:
[GEMINI.md#self-evolution-strategy](GEMINI.md#self-evolution-strategy)

Project-specific learnings and benchmarks for the LightRAG workspace are recorded in [SELF_EVOLUTION.md](file:///Users/marchansen/antigravity_lightrag/.agent/rules/SELF_EVOLUTION.md).
