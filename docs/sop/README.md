# Global Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

This directory contains the universal standard operating procedures and protocols that govern all agent behavior across workspaces.

## Core Protocols

- **[SOP.md](SOP.md)** - Global Agent Rules & Standard Operating Procedures
- **[NOMENCLATURE.md](NOMENCLATURE.md)** - Universal terms and definitions
- **[SELF_EVOLUTION_GLOBAL.md](SELF_EVOLUTION_GLOBAL.md)** - Global self-evolution strategy
- **[AGENT_ONBOARDING.md](AGENT_ONBOARDING.md)** - Universal agent onboarding guide
- **[CROSS_COMPATIBILITY.md](CROSS_COMPATIBILITY.md)** - Multi-IDE/agent compatibility standards
- **[HOW_TO_USE_BEADS.md](HOW_TO_USE_BEADS.md)** - Universal Beads usage guide

## Purpose

These global SOPs provide:

1. **Universal Standards** - Consistent behavior across all projects and agents
2. **Operational Protocols** - Standardized workflows (Initialization, Execution, Finalization)
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Guidelines for working across different IDEs and agents
4. **Evolution Framework** - Continuous improvement protocols for agents and systems

## Usage

All agents must:

1. Read and understand these protocols before starting work
2. Follow the standard protocols without deviation
3. Update protocols only through established evolution procedures
4. Maintain consistency across all workspaces and projects

## Integration with Workspaces

These global SOPs are automatically linked into each workspace's `.agent/docs/sop/global-configs/` directory for easy access and to ensure consistency across projects.
