## Workspace Coordination

When working across multiple workspaces:

1. **Session Isolation** - Use dedicated branches/worktrees for each workspace
2. **Agent Coordination** - Follow multi-agent protocols to avoid conflicts
3. **Resource Sharing** - Coordinate use of shared services (Automem, Langfuse)
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - Share learnings across related workspaces

## Global Services

Some services span multiple workspaces:

- **Automem** - Cross-session memory and learning
- **Langfuse** - Unified observability and monitoring
- **Beads** - Cross-project task tracking
- **Git** - Version control across all workspaces

## Standards

All workspaces should follow:

1. **Directory Structure** - Standard `.agent/` organization
2. **Protocols** - Global SOPs and local extensions
3. **Skills** - Global skills plus workspace-specific additions
4. **Documentation** - Consistent documentation patterns
