# Global Documentation

This directory contains universal documentation and resources for agents working across all projects and workspaces.

## Structure

- **[sop/](sop/)** - Standard Operating Procedures and universal protocols
- **[skills/](../skills/)** - Global agent capabilities and workflows
- **[rules/](../rules/)** - Universal rules and standards
- **[workspace/](workspace/)** - Global workspace management and coordination
- **[troubleshooting/](troubleshooting/)** - Global troubleshooting guides and solutions

## Purpose

The global `.agent` directory serves as the central hub for:

1. **Universal Standards** - Cross-project protocols and agent behavior
2. **Shared Capabilities** - Global skills and workflows available to all agents
3. **System Coordination** - Multi-agent and multi-workspace coordination
4. **Knowledge Management** - Persistent learning and evolution

## Usage

All agents should:

1. Study the global SOPs before working on any project
2. Use global skills as building blocks for project-specific work
3. Follow universal rules for consistency across workspaces
4. Contribute learnings back to global knowledge base

## Relationship to ~/.gemini

This structure replaces the previous `~/.gemini/` organization with a standardized `.agent/` directory that aligns with workspace-level organization, making navigation and knowledge management more intuitive across the entire system.
