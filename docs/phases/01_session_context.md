# Phase 1: Session Context

> **Status**: **MANDATORY** — Run at the start of every session  
> **Skill**: `/initialization-briefing`  
> **Back to**: [SOP Checklist](../SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md)

---

## Purpose

Prepare your mindset and capture environment before technical checks. Session Context focuses on **mental preparation**, not technical verification (that's Initialization's job).

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Review previous session context (what was accomplished, what's pending)
- [ ] Create friction log for real-time capture during work
- [ ] Note friction areas to watch from past sessions
- [ ] Set mental context for what you'll be working on

---

## What Session Context is NOT

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT** run technical checks here. That's Initialization (Phase 2).

| ❌ NOT Session Context | ✅ Session Context |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Running `bd ready` | Reviewing what you worked on last |
| Checking tool availability | Creating friction capture log |
| Reading ROADMAP.md | Setting mental context |
| Verifying plan approval | Remembering past friction areas |

---

## Key Areas to Watch During Work

While working, actively capture friction in these areas:

| Area | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 🔧 Tool Friction | Slow, buggy, or inefficient tools |
| 📝 Corrections | Direct user feedback and corrections |
| 🎨 Preferences | Coding style and architectural choices |
| ✅ Success Patterns | Approaches that work particularly well |
| 🚫 Failures | Mistakes and failed approaches |
| 🔄 Workarounds | Temporary fixes and alternatives |
| 📊 Performance | Bottlenecks and resource issues |
| 🤔 Confusion | Unclear requirements or instructions |
| 🛑 Roadblocks | Issues that completely stop progress |

## Friction Log Template

Create at session start:

```markdown
# Session Friction Log - [date]

## Quick Notes (add friction points as they happen)

- 
```

---

## Connection to Initialization

After Session Context, you'll run Initialization which:

1. Verifies tools are available
2. Runs `bd ready` to see available tasks
3. Checks plan approval status
4. Validates with the Orchestrator

**Workflow:**

```text
Session Context → Initialization → Have task context → Planning → Work
      ↓               ↓
  Mindset ready    Tools verified, task selected
```
