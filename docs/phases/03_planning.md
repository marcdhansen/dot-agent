# Phase 3: Planning

> **Status**: **MANDATORY** for new features/significant changes  
> **Skill**: `/plan scope <task-id>`  
> **Back to**: [SOP Checklist](../SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md)

---

## Purpose

Define what will be built, how it will be verified, and get user approval before execution.

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Create/update `implementation_plan.md` with proposed changes
- [ ] Perform blast radius analysis for significant changes
- [ ] Define milestones and success criteria
- [ ] Get user approval before proceeding to the Execution Phase
- [ ] **Create/Identify Beads Issue**: Mandatory before starting execution
- [ ] Update `task.md` with current objectives

## Detailed Requirements

### Blast Radius Analysis

Progressive disclosure levels:

| Level | When to Use | Includes |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Level 1 (Summary)** | Quick assessment | Risk level, affected files count, timeline impact |
| **Level 2 (Detailed)** | Development planning | Dependency chains, test coverage gaps, migration needs |
| **Level 3 (Deep-Dive)** | P0/P1 changes | Performance implications, security, long-term maintenance |

- [ ] **Level 1**: Quick overview with risk assessment
- [ ] **Level 2**: Module-level analysis if needed
- [ ] **Level 3**: Full architectural review for P0/P1

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create/update `implementation_plan.md`
- [ ] Document proposed changes by component
- [ ] Define verification plan (tests, manual validation)
- [ ] Identify rollback procedures

### Milestones

- [ ] Define success criteria for each phase
- [ ] Establish validation checkpoints
- [ ] Document A/B testing requirements if applicable

### Approval

> [!CAUTION]
> **Explicit Execution Approval Required**: Planning-to-Execution transition is BLOCKED until user provides explicit approval.

- [ ] Present plan to user for review
- [ ] Address feedback and update plan
- [ ] **Receive explicit approval** (e.g., "👍 APPROVED FOR EXECUTION")
- [ ] Record approval timestamp in `task.md`
